If you have suggestions, feel free to add me through Discord ChristoAg#1774 or send an email through my address: @christopherbackup151@gmail.com (I am truly sorry for late responses, but I will update to you soon). This programme will undergo constant updates to add features and remove errors.

NOTEWORTHY INFOS:
In order to run this programme, you need to use some kind of software like Visual Studio Code that will help you run the programme. 
Also, not to forget that you need to install Python (at least version 3) first before running this code above!
